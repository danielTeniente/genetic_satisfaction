This is a program made for fun.
I wanted to maximize the way I feel at the end of the day.
In the task.csv file you should put your aims and the level
of satisfaction that you get in long and short term.

The good python script is genetic_satisfaction_from_csv.py
the other one was the first but i didnÂ´t like the way i did it. (Also is incomplete)
I let you see the fisrt one because maybe that idea is also good.

Look at the example task.csv to see the way you should write your aims.

You also should write the hours per day you want to planificate
as an argument of the script.

Explanation:
I use a genetic algorithm to make a schedule.
That schedule depends of the satisfaction I feel
when I do a task. So, I can use this algorithm 
to maximize my satisfaction and feel better.
